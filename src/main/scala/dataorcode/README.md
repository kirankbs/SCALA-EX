#Data Or Code Example

Example is created in scala but programmer can think about in his favourite language.

This Example is taken from Martin Odersky scala course.

Representation of Natural Numbers in Mathematics like 1,2,3 .

Assume that there are no numbers in programming and implement Natural Numbers

Example is simply explaining about Natural numbers without using Number system

Please Look into test written using Junit and try to understand it for better explanation

It is just Code ryt but representing Natural Numbers.

Conclusion:-
    There is nothing like data in Programming. 
    Anything can be build by code.
    Keypoints:-
        Sets/Types/Objects
        Morphisms/Functions/Operator

Suggestion:-
    Study about Category Theory for best understanding of Any Program Language.
